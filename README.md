# m-onmyown
A couple of scripts used to fetch schedule changes.

# docxtable.py
Current one in use, verified to be working. Just what's needed to get and parse the changes.

# htmltable.py
My eleventh grade experimentation with python. The table parser turned out pretty well but other than that it's mostly trash.
